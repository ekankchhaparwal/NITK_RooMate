## Aim

The Room-Exchange-System aims to provide a platform for individuals seeking to exchange rooms, facilitating the process of finding suitable room exchange partners.

## Introduction

The Room-Exchange-System is a dynamic and user-friendly web application designed to ease the process of finding room exchange opportunities.

Finding suitable accommodation can be a daunting task, especially when faced with the challenges of compatibility with potential roommates. Traditional methods of searching for roommates or listing available rooms often lack the flexibility and efficiency required to meet the needs of individuals seeking room exchanges.

Our portal addresses these challenges by providing a centralized platform where users can create detailed room listings, browse available listings based on their preferences, and communicate with potential room exchange partners. The portal offers a seamless and intuitive solution to facilitate the search.

The back end handles user authentication, listing management, and messaging/ and room selection functionalities, while the front end provides an intuitive user interface for interacting with the portal.

## Results

Through the Room-Exchange-System, users can successfully find room exchange partners, facilitating seamless transitions between different rooms.
